This study presents a novel, data-driven framework utilizing PCA to reveal conceptual trends among Pritzker Prize laureates, structured through dual layman and artist-philosopher dictionaries. The analysis uncovered significant shifts in architectural priorities—such as a growing emphasis on sustainability, contextualism, and the reinterpretation of tradition. By minimizing subjective bias and providing a scalable method, this framework enhances our understanding of design philosophies within cultural contexts. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining quantitative methods with layered conceptual analysis, offering new insights into the evolving landscape of architectural thought. This structured model sets a new benchmark for computational methods in architectural research. We anticipate that this approach will inform future studies by providing a replicable framework for analyzing architectural trends. By open-sourcing the database and schema, we encourage collaboration and further exploration, fostering new insights in computational architectural research. This study provides a proof of concept based on limited textual data, which may not capture the full spectrum of each architect's philosophy. Future research could incorporate additional data sources or explore other computational techniques to build upon this foundation.

The study is structured on three critical data resources to explore the philosophies of Pritzker laureates computationally:

Main Concept-Subconcept Dictionary: This dictionary organizes broad architectural themes—such as Minimalism, Innovation, Functionality, Aesthetics, and more—into specific sub-concepts. For instance, Minimalism relates to "Simplicity," Innovation to "Novelty," and Functionality to "Efficiency." This structure provides a foundation for thematic analysis, mapping abstract architectural ideas to measurable attributes.

Artist-Philosopher Pairing Dataset: This dataset links architectural concepts with influential artists and philosophers, each assigned to specific "hemisphere triplets" (combinations of three core concepts). Each triplet forms a "coinage" or coined term that reflects the intersection of the artist’s style and philosopher’s theory. For example, the triplet Minimalism, Innovation, and Functionality pairs Donald Judd's minimalist forms with Wittgenstein's linguistic precision, termed "Exacting Systems," symbolizing architecture grounded in logical clarity and functional structure.

Laureate Database: This includes detailed profiles of each laureate, covering their winning statements, renowned projects, personal reflections, and significant quotes. The data spans numerous laureates, from Philip Johnson to recent winners like Francis Kéré, providing comprehensive context to examine architectural philosophies through computationally inferred positions in conceptual space.

These resources collectively facilitate a multi-layered analysis, bridging intuitive accessibility and in-depth philosophical insights through both layman and artist-philosopher perspectives.
