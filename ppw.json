The very same periodicity: dawn to dusk, dusk to dawn; spring following, winter after winter.

My clan, of materials’ position, with people, ordained, and by myself, the layman, encompassing superstition, within this plan, suspended. Architecture is differentiation, with respect to space, maybe material, sometimes visual; then selectively integrated, all but a limiting procedure, that approximates our inhabitatness. A unit of architecture is neither the form or the function of a space, but a lecture, on affective form, between relations, of the uninhibited. Like art, a vehicle for observation and reflection, architecture is not, quite just that. Adding more meaning and symbols to architecture does not make it any more architectural, nor is it any less, when the only direct interventions, are a matter of practicality.

Fragments of functions, modulated across and in, dwelling, of presence and absence.Geometries outlining form, solids or voids, separating space for function, therefore meaning, is found in both form and function. Combining words together, a prose of dwelling is written.Dwell without structures, is to dwell away from home, as in the forms by dwelling, reveals it, inasmuch as traces and erasure, creating a figurative delineation, that is constrained, only, by our physical impedance.Finishedness and stability are not sufficiently the same, nor necessary orthogonal. Prefab and onsite bespoke, need not be discriminated against each other, since becoming commodities, from their original genesis, is just what we call progress.If my dwelling is read, please read it as it was written, rather than as people speak of it, or as it was spoken by others.",

         "The 'Wordless Unspoken' architecture demo project brings Jimi Wen's philosophy to life, merging form, meaning, and space. The design integrates principles of incompleteness, multifunctionality, abstraction, and interconnectedness. I argue that well-trained LLMs can surpass traditional teams and hierarchy, replacing contemporary best practice with unmatched efficiency and innovation. Referencing Alan Turing’s insight that “if a machine is expected to be infallible, it cannot also be intelligent,” I assert that LLMs should mimic aesthetic intelligence rather than exhibit human-like intelligence. Even under the weak AI hypothesis, AI can significantly impact architectural practice, as demonstrated by the tuning of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in architectural modelling.",
         "Like architecture, a vessel for, dwelling and rest, less nested, art is not, exactly that. Adding more conceptual nodes and experiential edges do not make it any more art. Nor is it any less, when the only reflections, are a matter of nomenclature. The reflections on your day, of another day, and in doing so inevitably reformat itself, to reframe such moment, that has already passed by.",
         "Jimi Wen explains that AI reflects and amplifies human intention. The low guidance diffusion method strikes the balance by setting a framework but not restricting AI, allowing it to explore freely and capture deeper meanings. This method enables AI to pursue profound meanings without being confined to superficial likeness. This is akin to the concept from 思無字: “Writing does not exhaust words, words do not exhaust meaning, and meaning likewise does not exhaust characters that are generative in nature."
